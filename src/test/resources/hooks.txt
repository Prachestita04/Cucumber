background keyword - should be a part of feature file

hooks keyword and its implementation also--
not part of feature file
it has to be written in runner file
can be written in step definition class
or it can be written in a separate configuration class

Note: -
1. tags in cucumber is equivalent to groups in testng.
2. hooks in cucumber is equivalent to annotation in testng.
3. order in cucumber is equivalent to priority in testng
4. Scenario implementation in cucumber is equivalent to @Test in testng
5. Scenario means actually a test case only
6. background actually consists of shared pre-requisites(@Given)
and shared test steps(@When)
7. Given - pre-requisites, When - Test steps, Then - expected result
8. Hooks with Tags in cucumber is equivalent to annotations with groups in testng
Ex: - @Before("@Login") is equivalent to @Test(groups='login')
9.gluecode means step definition.


*setup
    will be executed before each scenario - - @Before
*teardown
     will be executed after each Scenario

@Before
m1(order=1)
@Before
m2(order=2)

@After
m1(order=1)
@After
m2(order=2)

@BeforeStep -- Before each step of the scenario
@AfterStep -- after each step of the scenario

@Before
@BeforeStep
